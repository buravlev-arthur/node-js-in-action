"He was the most daring aviator and greatest fighter pilot of the entire war," Captain "Eddie" V. Rickenbacker said of Luke, according to the Air Force. Rickenbacker was the leading Ace while Luke was America's second-ranking Ace in World War I. Ace airmen are credited with shooting down five or more aircraft — and Luke achieved the status in two missions over the course of two days.
Rickenbacker added: "His life is one of the brightest glories of our Air Service."
The Air Force did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
The modern-day balloon surveillance device shot down on Saturday — which Chinese officials acknowledge came from their country, but maintain was a civilian airship "used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes" — had been drifting over the continental United States for five days before it was shot down.
